ACTIVE PATIENCE. THE SCIENCE OF POWER.
=================================

THERE IS ONLY ONE TYPE OF PATIENCE: THE ACTIVE ONE. 

PATIENCE IS TOTAL ACTION HAPPENING IN A PERSONAL-INVISIBLE-SPIRITUAL-CHANNEL.  

PATIENCE IS THE ACTIVE STATEMENT THAT SERVES AS PROOF OF WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE BUT THAT NOBODY CAN SEE, YET.

PATIENCE IS BEING PULLED BY YOUR DREAM'S GRAVITATIONAL FORCE. 

THE BIGGER AND STRONGER THE DREAM MORE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE IT HAS. AND IT WILL PULL YOU, IT WILL MAKE YOU BECOME ITS SERVANT. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS. 

IF YOU ARE IN COMMAND OF YOUR LIFE, THERE IS SOMETHING BADLY WRONG. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY, COUNTERINTUITIVE STUFF IN THE UNIVERSE. MANY VOICES TELL US THAT WE HAVE TO BE BE IN THE COMMAND AND CONTROL OF OUR LIVES. MOSTLY IT IS A BLOODY LIE! 

WE HAVE TO LOSE CONTROL OF OUR LIVES SURRENDERING IT TO OUR DREAMS. THE ONLY THING WE SHOULD HAVE CONTROL OF IS THE DECISION TO LET POWER GO TO OUR DREAMS. 

FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU ARE TIRED AND THE SLEEP IT TAKES CONTROL OF YOU THEN YOU SLEEP, THE SAME HAS TO HAPPEN FROM YOUR DREAMS BUT WITH THE REVERSE EFFECT.

WHEN SLEEPING BODY RESTS, SOUL WORKS. WHEN DREAMS TAKES CONTROL OVER YOUR AWAKE LIFE, SOUL RESTS AND BODY WORKS.
